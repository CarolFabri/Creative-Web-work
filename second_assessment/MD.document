Purpose and Audience

The app is made for entertainment and to bring the user into a mystical world.
The purpose of the app is to find out your luck in two different ways. The first way is through a palm reading, 
where the user takes a photo of their hand and receives a fortune message. The second way is through a 
Romani-style fortune reading in a chat, where the user can ask questions about love, health, or career.

Technology Stack and Application Architecture

For the technology, I am using Node.js as the backend, MongoDB as the database, and EJS to render the pages.
On the frontend I use JavaScript, the camera API (getUserMedia), and I will also use APIs for the chatbot.
The backend receives the hand image, selects a message based on the topic, and sends it back to the user.

UI/UX Design Considerations
For the UI/UX design, I am creating the layout using tools like Adobe Express, Adobe Fresco, and Photoshop.
My goal is to make the design look mystical but still simple and easy for the user to navigate.

Major Features and MVP
The main features and MVP are:
• Taking a photo of the user’s hand
• Sending the image to the backend
• Choosing a topic (love, career, health)
• Receiving a random fortune reading
• A small chatbot that only talks about the three topics

Anticipated Challenges
The main challenges I expect are learning how to work with APIs, making the camera run correctly, 
and making sure the chatbot answers stay on topic. Another challenge is making an existing API or tool look unique inside my own design.

Experiments Undertaken
So far, I have experimented with the camera API and with the OpenAI API for the chatbot. I plan to use more APIs later as the project continues.

Learning Points from Independent Study
From my independent study, I have taken LinkedIn Learning courses for JavaScript and Node. 
I was considering learning React, but I decided to continue using EJS because
I still need to focus on backend skills and keep the project simpler.
